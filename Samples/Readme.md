# Samples

These samples were specifically created to test and denomstrate QuickNeil, and with that the Neil programming language

They can show a bit of what Neil can do... Please note Neil is set up for scripting usage, and QuickNeil is merely for prototyping, and is not really capable to do big things.
To really see what Neil can do a more serious project putting Neil to action may be required, I'm afraid

Anyway enjoy QuickNeil....
